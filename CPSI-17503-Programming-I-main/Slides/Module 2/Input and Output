## Input/Output (input() and print())

### Slide 1: Interacting with the User

  * A program is more useful when it can interact with the user.
  * **Output:** Displaying information to the user (using `print()`).
  * **Input:** Getting information from the user (using `input()`).

### Slide 2: Output with `print()`

  * The `print()` function is used to display output on the console.
  * You can print strings, numbers, variables, and more.
  * You can pass multiple items to `print()`, and it will separate them with a space.

<!-- end list -->
```py

print("Hello, World!")

name = "Alice"
age = 30
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)

# Using an f-string for formatted output (recommended)
print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}")
```
### Slide 3: Input with `input()`

  * The `input()` function prompts the user to enter some text and returns it as a **string**.
  * You can provide a string to `input()` to be used as a prompt.

<!-- end list -->
```py

# Prompt the user for their name
name = input("Please enter your name: ")

# Greet the user
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```
### Slide 4: `input()` and Type Conversion

  * **Important:** `input()` always returns a string.
  * If you need to treat the input as a number, you must convert it using `int()` or `float()`.

<!-- end list -->
```py

age_str = input("Please enter your age: ")

# Convert the string to an integer
age_int = int(age_str)

# Now you can do math with it
years_until_100 = 100 - age_int

print(f"You will be 100 years old in {years_until_100} years.")

```
### Slide 5: Further Reading and Practice

  * **Further Reading:** *Think Python, 2nd Edition*, Chapter 1: "The way of the program" and Chapter 2: "Variables, expressions and statements".
  * **Practice Exercise:**
      * Write a program that asks the user for their name and their favorite color and then prints a message combining both.
      * Write a program that asks for two numbers, adds them together, and prints the result. Remember to convert the input to numbers\!
