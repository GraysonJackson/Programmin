## Variables and Types

### Slide 1: What is a Variable?

  * A **variable** is a named location in memory where you can store a value.
  * You can think of it as a labeled box where you put information.
  * You give a variable a name, and you can change the value it holds.

### Slide 2: Assigning Values to Variables

  * In Python, you use the assignment operator (`=`) to assign a value to a variable.

<!-- end list -->
```py

# Assign the string "Alice" to the variable 'name'
name = "Alice"

# Assign the integer 30 to the variable 'age'
age = 30

# Now we can use the variables
print(name)  # Output: Alice
print(age)   # Output: 30
```
### Slide 3: Basic Data Types

Every value in Python has a **data type**. Here are some fundamental types:

  * **Integer (`int`):** Whole numbers, like `10`, `-5`, `0`.
  * **Float (`float`):** Numbers with a decimal point, like `3.14`, `-0.5`.
  * **String (`str`):** A sequence of characters, enclosed in single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.
  * **Boolean (`bool`):** Represents truth values, either `True` or `False`.

### Slide 4: Checking a Variable's Type

You can use the `type()` function to see the data type of a variable.
```py

message = "Hello, Python!"
count = 5
pi = 3.14159
is_learning = True

print(type(message))    # Output: <class 'str'>
print(type(count))      # Output: <class 'int'>
print(type(pi))         # Output: <class 'float'>
print(type(is_learning))# Output: <class 'bool'>
```
### Slide 5: Further Reading and Practice

  * **Further Reading:** *Think Python, 2nd Edition*, Chapter 2: "Variables, expressions and statements".
  * **Practice Exercise:**
      * Create variables of different types (integer, float, string, boolean) and print their values and types.
      * Create a variable `x` and assign it a value. Then, assign a new value to `x`. Print `x` after each assignment to see how its value changes.
