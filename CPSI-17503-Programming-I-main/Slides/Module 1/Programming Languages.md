## Programming Languages

### Slide 1: What are Programming Languages?

  * A **programming language** is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.
  * They are used to create programs that control the behavior of a machine.
  * Like human languages, they have syntax (rules for structure) and semantics (rules for meaning).

### Slide 2: High-Level vs. Low-Level Languages

  * **Low-Level Languages:**
      * Closer to the hardware (e.g., machine code, assembly language).
      * Less readable for humans.
      * Offer fine-grained control over the computer's hardware.
  * **High-Level Languages:**
      * More abstract and easier for humans to read and write (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
      * Need to be translated into a low-level language for the computer to understand.
      * Python is a very high-level language, which makes it easier to write programs quickly.

### Slide 3: Interpreters and Compilers

  * Computers only understand machine code. High-level languages need to be translated.
  * **Interpreter:** Reads a high-level program and executes it, one line at a time.
      * Python is an interpreted language. This makes testing and debugging faster.
  * **Compiler:** Reads the entire high-level program and translates it into a low-level program (object code or executable) all at once. The resulting program is then run.

### Slide 4: Example: Python as a High-Level Language

This Python code is easy for a human to understand. The Python interpreter translates these commands into instructions the computer can execute.
```python
# A simple program to greet the user
name = "Alice"
print("Hello, " + name)
```
### Slide 5: Further Reading and Practice

  * **Further Reading:** *Think Python, 2nd Edition*, Chapter 1: "The way of the program".
  * **Practice Exercise:**
      * Think about the difference between telling a friend how to make a sandwich step-by-step (interpreting) versus writing down the full recipe for them to follow later (compiling).
      * Write a simple Python program that prints your name and age.
