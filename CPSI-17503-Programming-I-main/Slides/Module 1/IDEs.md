## IDEs

### Slide 1: What is an IDE?

  * An **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.
  * An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger.

### Slide 2: Common Features of IDEs

  * **Source Code Editor:** A text editor designed for writing and editing code. It often includes syntax highlighting and autocomplete.
  * **Debugger:** A tool to help you find and fix errors (bugs) in your code. You can run your code step-by-step and inspect the state of your variables.
  * **Interpreter/Compiler Integration:** The ability to run or compile your code directly from the IDE.
  * **Project Management:** Tools for organizing your files and managing dependencies.
  * **Version Control Integration:** Support for version control systems like Git.

### Slide 3: Popular Python IDEs

  * **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** A free, open-source, and highly extensible code editor with excellent Python support through extensions.
  * **PyCharm:** A powerful and feature-rich IDE specifically for Python, with a free Community edition.
  * **Thonny:** A beginner-friendly Python IDE with a built-in debugger.
  * **Jupyter Notebook:** A web-based interactive computing environment that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

### Slide 4: Example: Using an IDE

An IDE helps you write cleaner code and find errors faster.
``` python
# In an IDE with syntax highlighting, the following would be color-coded:
# 'def', 'name', 'print', '"Hello, "'

def greet(name):
    # An IDE might suggest a typo fix if you wrote 'prnt' instead of 'print'
    print("Hello, " + name)

# You can set a breakpoint on the line below in the debugger
# to inspect the value of 'name' before the function is called.
greet("Alice")
```
### Slide 5: Further Reading and Practice

  * **Further Reading:** Explore the documentation for the IDE of your choice.
  * **Practice Exercise:**
      * Install a Python IDE like VS Code or Thonny.
      * Write a simple Python script in the IDE and run it.
      * Try setting a breakpoint and running the debugger.
